# diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout

diamond\ (read as diamond backslash) is a mirroring keyboard layout.

Currently only works by using a kbd file with the program Kanata, the kanata.kbd file is located in the proof of concept folder. Please read the file as there are bugs listed in it.

The kanata.kbd file is to be used with Kanata which was created by [jtroo, link to Kanata repo here: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)

## The quick intro of the diamond\ keyboard layout

![Image of the diamond\ keyboard layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r134x7/diamond_backslash/refs/heads/main/images/diamond_backslash.png)

Things that make the diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout standout:
- Designed to make the best out of the limitations and flaws of the row-staggered keyboard.
- Slightly right-hand dominant as opposed to QWERTY which is VERY left-hand dominant in keystroke usage.
- The majority of keys pressed will be in the home row followed by the upper row and then the lower row.
- Extremely low Lateral Stretch Bigram keystrokes and Ringer Finger Lateral Stretch Bigram keystroke usage due to knowing what keys are flawed to press frequently on a row-staggered keyboard.
- Delicate balance of Same Finger Bigram keystrokes to Scissor keystrokes to make certain Same Finger Bigrams easier to type and to make certain Scissor keystrokes less awkward to press.
- Due to the layout being slightly right-hand dominant due to more letter keys on the right side, there is a high rate of Alternating Hands Trigram keystrokes, this means you will switch hands often for keystrokes as opposed to QWERTY where the majority of keystrokes occur on the left hand.
- High rate of Bigram Roll In keystrokes, enjoy the feeling of doing two keystrokes where the keys are next to each other.
- Very low Trigram Redirect rate, this means that on three keystrokes using the same hand, there will be a low chance that your hand suddenly changes direction during those keystrokes.
- The keyboard layout is optimized for English and its performance values may not be as good in other languages.
- The caps lock button is set as backspace although I could change it to other keys such as escape to make it more VIM friendly but the escape key would not be as frequently used by others.

Now the most imporant feature that gives it its name as a mirroring keyboard layout:

Switch between your primary keyboard layout to a secondary keyboard layout by pressing and holding a key very briefly. This is intended for programs like VIM where diamond\ isn't VIM-friendly but switching to QWERTY very quickly will let you use VIM during NORMAL MODE as it was designed around a QWERTY keyboard. No need to have to customise your VIM layouts as you are encourage to be skilled with using two keybard layouts: Your primary layout and your secondary layout.

### "Oh no, another keyboard layout"

Yes, I have joined the fray. I will give some backstory and also explain why this isn't just another keyboard layout.

## Backstory

The first keyboard layout I learned was QWERTY but I did not learn proper touch typing. Then in the year 2022 for particular reasons I wanted to improve my typing skills so I learned a keyboard layout called Colemak.

I spent a month or so learning the layout and after I had reached the end of practicing with every keystroke I then noticed issues with the layout, the main one being the frequency with which I had to stretch my index fingers to press the keys on the inner columns.

I did find out about an unofficial layout called the Colemak dh-mod layout but this just made me feel that if there were flaws with the layout that I would be better off designing my own keyboard layout.

Unfortunately, I had no idea how to design it exactly in a way that it would work for me besides removing the flaws in the inner columns which is what the Colemak dh-mod solved already. Later that year in 2022 I then found out about another keyboard layout called Engram which released in 2021, I was happy to use this layout since it was a different style of typing that removed letters from the inner columns of the keyboard and instead replaced it with punctuation symbols. Another convenience of the Engram keyboard layout was that I did not have to worry about knowing what key to press if I used the ctrl and/or alt keys as the keyboard layout would default to QWERTY of which my muscle memory would activate for using the shortcut keys for undo, copy, paste, etc.

I spent years using the Engram keyboard layout and kept an average of 80 words per minute when typing. Then as it got to the end of the year in 2025 I found out that the creator of the Engram keyboard layout had released a new version of the Engram keyboard layout and that's when I decided I would look around once more to see if any new keyboards had also appeared while I wasn't looking.

That was when I saw a keyboard layout called Hands Down (HD) Promethium which caught my interest. It was a keyboard layout built in collaboration between 3 people who each have worked on their own keyboard layouts. The keyboard layout looked interesting and it had some pretty good analytics that were given via the webpage [created by cyanophage on github.](https://cyanophage.github.io/)

I was thinking about learning that keyboard layout next year but there was one problem, its "canonical layout" was designed for ergonomic keyboards and I don't have the money for that where the kind of keyboard needed would be split in half, have an ortholinear or column-staggered layout and have a lot of thumb keys beside the space bar which got turned into a small key.

In reaction to that it was probably the right time that I would have a try again at designing my own keyboard layout.

### "Well, that was a nice story but I have to sleep."

Wait, I have to go over the design philosophy of my keyboard layout and you will learn why I call the diamond\ layout a "mirroring keyboard layout."

### "What?"

## Design Philosophy

Before the diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout existed, there was a prototype keyboard layout I created that I called gdmlk\

Here is what the prototype keyboard layout called gdmlk\ looks like:
![Image of the prototype keyboard layout called gdmlk\\](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r134x7/diamond_backslash/refs/heads/main/images/prototype_gdmlk_backslash.png)

### "Hey, that looks like it's a mirror image of the diamond\ layout, is that why you call it mirroring?"

That is a good observation but it is not the reason. Let's first go over how I designed the gdmlk\ prototype, I first used the Hands Down Promethium keyboard as a base on a row-staggered keyboard. I liked how a lot of the frequently pressed letter keys were on the home row and away from the inner columns. As I mentioned already, HD Promethium is designed as a keyboard layout for ergonomic keyboards and thus what became the base would be altered dramatically for what I know that I dislike on row-staggered keyboards.

The fundamental basis of my design rooted in my dislike of row-staggered keyboards shaped the name of the keyboard layout having a backslash at the end of it because it is the most important key in the keyboard.

### "How is a key that I barely use that important?"

That is a good question of which I need to make reference to the QWERTY keyboard layout. In the QWERTY keyboard layout there are 6 keys in the inner column where the index fingers are used, in the upper row you have the 'T' key followed by the 'Y' key, then in the home row you have the 'G' key followed by the 'H' key, in the lower row is the 'B' key followed by the 'N' key.

If you start from the 'Y' Key and go clockwise to each adjacent key: 'H' then 'B' then the 'G' key, these are what I would describe as the worst keys to press in a row-staggered keyboard.

Using the keyboard layout analytics website created by  [created by cyanophage on github: (https://cyanophage.github.io/)](https://cyanophage.github.io/) I set up a keyboard layout on that website by editing QWERTY to set it to an ANSI keyboard, replicated the HD Promethium layout as best I could and then I started with looking at the least pressed keys on the heatmap which lead to the YHBG QWERTY keys being replaced with the \;/j keys.

I then looked at the statistics that the webpage was reading out and adjusted the keys around to get a lower word effort rating. What caught my attention for that stats being read out for my prototype keyboard layout gdmlk\ was that Left Hand/Right Hand Finger Usage was Left Hand: 49.39%/Right Hand: 50.61% but more than that, I noticed that the Lateral Stretch Bigrams was reading 0.07% which was pretty low, as a side effect the Scissor Keystrokes was 0.05%.

While that sounds good and the Same Finger Bigrams was 0.95% the issue was that I didn't notice the other statistics being read out until I clicked on the arrows showing it. The Pinky/Ring Scissor Keystrokes was 0.79% and the Wide Scissor Keystrokes was 0.65% which seemed high to me and then I found that the Ring Finger Lateral Stretch Bigrams were 0.16%

### "I have no idea what you're talking about."

## Keystroke Analytics

Ok, the word effort score getting lower is good because it means it takes less effort to type a word. Finger Distance which read 208.9 is a score that is good the lower it goes because it means your fingers take less distance to travel. Upper Row/Home Row/Lower Row usage was 28.93%/59.57%/10.60% meaning that most keys pressed were on the home row followed by the upper row and then the lower row.

Same Finger Bigrams refers to two keystrokes being pressed with the same finger, logically you'd think that getting the a low Same Finger Bigram score is good but when you read the analytics you learn that you have to have a delicate balance between same finger bigrams and scissor keystrokes (because you can't decrease same finger bigram keystrokes without increasing scissor keystrokes). How I choose what to have depends on what kind of same finger bigram keystroke and what kind of scissor keystroke I would have on a row-staggered keyboard.

Lateral Stretch Bigrams refers to stretching keystrokes such as stretching your index fingers to reach the YHBG keys on a QWERTY keyboard for example. Then Ring Finger Lateral Stretch Bigrams refers to something like pressing the S key with your ring finger and reaching for the Y key with your index finger, it's not a separate action so you can feel that stretch to your ring finger. On the gdmlk\ prototype keyboard layout, the most notable example of this issue was pressing the R key with your left ring finger followed by the K key with your left index finger.

### "Uh huh."

Anyway, I kept trying to make adjustments on the keys used for the right hand of the keyboard but it was very difficult to add anymore consonants to a group of vowels in one hand on the gdmlk\ prototype layout. That was when I decided that I would start over using the gdmlk\ prototype keyboard layout as the base and build from there.

## Building diamond\

The first thing I noticed was how there is more keys to use on the right hand than the left so I made two changes, instead of having this almost perfect balance of finger usage on both hands, I would instead make the right hand slightly dominant and, I would flip the keyboard layout horizontally so that the vowels would now be on the left hand with less keys surrounding them.

### "So you "mirrored" the keyboard layout you say?"

Unfortunately. that is not the reason why it is called a mirroring keyboard layout. As I flipped the keyboard layout that meant the keys would be reversed, now the \\;/j keys became \j/; in clockwise.

Besides rearranging the keys to lower the scores I wanted, I realised it was better that the ".", "," and "'" were better placed on the lower row of the left hand because following the four inner column keys that I dislike, the two lower row keys that I dislike pressing on a row-staggered keyboard are the keys that require the pinky finger and the middle finger.

You have to understand that the row-staggered keyboard is an odd design especially with how it ended up with QWERTY being paired with it. The rows stagger in a direction like a backslash "\\\\\\\\\\", each column stretches in that direction like a backslash meaning that there are more keys that are much easier to press for your right hand than your left hand. It is very awkward pressing a lower row letter key with your left pinky because it doesn't move down and right, it has an easier time moving down to the left shift key just to the edge of it. Following that, the left middle finger pressing a lower row key is difficult as well because it is too long when reaching down.

This is why in comparison it is much easier to press lower row keys with your right hand due to the way that a row-staggered keyboard is designed. That is why I made my keyboard become slightly more right-hand dominant by fitting as many consonants for the right hand to use with the vowels on the left hand.

Following that, I ended up making many iterations of the keyboard layout built on gdmlk\ and as I read the data I was focused on getting that delicate balance of Same Finger Bigrams and Scissor Keystrokes because I had already gotten the Lateral Stretch Bigrams down to a satisfactory level.

My goal was to have a decent balance of Same Finger Bigrams to Scissor Keystrokes by reducing as much undesirable keystrokes as possible and increasing keystrokes that I would rather be fine doing instead.

For Same Finger Bigrams this meant paying attention to which fingers were used most. Reading the results from the diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout I ended up with:

`Same Finger Bigrams frequency for each finger`
L Pinky 1 | L Ring 2 | L Middle 3 | L Index  4 | R Index 7 | R Middle 8 | R Ring 9 | R Pinky 10
--- | --- | ---
0.06% | 0.09% | 0.08% | 0.28% | 0.18% | 0.04% | 0.12% | 0.14%

From this you can see that the worst fingers for same finger bigram frequency on the diamond\ layout are the Left Index finger, then the Right Index finger, then the Right pinky. This is expected since all three of these fingers have access to two columns and thus, they each press up to six keys with the same finger.

It was intentional for me to have the most same finger bigrams to occur on the index fingers, I tried as much as I could to reduce same finger bigrams on the right pinky finger which is resting on the home row with the N key surrounded by lesser pressed keys for the right pinky finger.

Here is a diamond\ heatmap from the website by cyanophage to illustrate that:
![Image of diamond\ keyboard layout heatmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r134x7/diamond_backslash/refs/heads/main/images/diamond_backslash_heatmap.jpg)

Onto the scissor keystrokes and the delicate balance I mentioned. There are scissor keystrokes you do with your index finger on the upper or lower row followed by the middle finger in the remaining row or having all that be done in a different order. The most frequent scissor keystroke of that type is typing 'ld' which I preferred that if I was going to do a scissor keystroke, it would be using the strongest fingers in my hand.

Pinky/Ring Scissors involves the fingers as mentioned but it doesn't require that they are separated by the upper and lower rows. The most frequent pinky/ring scissors keystroke is 'nc', it was the best that I could compromise with and I am fine with it because the 'N' key is located on the home row where the right pinky finger rests and the 'C' key is in the upper row for the right ring finger. The pinky ring finger is weaker so it makes sense for the ring finger to travel.

Lastly there's the Wide Scissors keystroke of which you could have something terrible such as pressing the 'B' key with your right pinky finger and the 'M' key with your right index finger. That's why the biggest breakthrough to reduce that kind of keystroke was to flip the upper and lower rows in the right hand and adjust things from there.

I noticed then that it was better for the 'L' key to be pressed by the right index finger on the lower row due to its frequency because its previous location on the upper row actually felt further away.

There were two frequently pressed Wide Scissors keystrokes, the 'ld' keystroke followed by the 'cl' keystroke and once again, the compromise was that these are keystrokes that are done with anything but your pinky finger.

### "Ok, so how does the diamond\ layout compare to others?"

## Keyboard Layout Stats Comparison

Now that you have gotten an idea of how these keystrokes are analysed, you should have a better idea of how the diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout compares to others. The below images are of different keyboard layouts (QWERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, Engram 2021, HD Promethium) to compare to both gdmlk\ and diamond\\, the only keyboard layouts I haven't used in that list are Dvorak and HD Promethium. The data once again was generated from [cyanophage's webpage: (https://cyanophage.github.io/)](https://cyanophage.github.io/)

![Image of keyboard layout statistical comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r134x7/diamond_backslash/refs/heads/main/images/keyboard_stats_1.jpg)

![Second image of keyboard layout statistical comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r134x7/diamond_backslash/refs/heads/main/images/keyboard_stats_2.jpg)

### "HD Promethium looks to be the best keyboard layout on the list."

Yes, a reminder that it was designed for an ergonomic keyboard where you can use your left thumb to press the 'R' key which is why an extra finger being used that is much stronger than the pinky really reduces the word effort score by a lot.

When you compare only the keyboard layouts that are used on row-staggered keyboards, diamond\ ends up having some really interesting stats. A finger distance travelled of 201.1 which is only higher than Colemak's better score of 198.6.

I had to sacrifice a bit on the same finger bigrams which is why diamond\ rates at 0.98% compared to the others that are lower.

The most interesting stat was how I signficantly improved Lateral Stretch Bigrams and Ring Finger Lateral Stretch Bigrams from gdmlk\ to diamond\, that diamond\ has a 0.02% for both categories is amazing especially when you compare it to the other keyboard layouts.

Again I had to sacrifice on scissor keystrokes that the ratings look similar to other layouts.

For the remaining Trigram labelled stats, besides the high rate of Bigram Roll In keystrokes for diamond\\, the stat that stood out to me the most was that diamond\ managed to get a Redirect rate of 1.14% and a Weak Redirect rate of 0.52% which was a significant improvement over gdmlk\\, that means that the rate of doing a trigram keystroke where your keystrokes go in one direction but then change to the other direction on the same hand is very low.

What I also notice is that the only other row-staggered keyboard with as low a redirect rate is Dvorak which is a keyboard layout I have not used.

### "Are you going to explain what a mirroring keyboard is now?"

## The mirroring keyboard layout

Yes, what I refer to as mirroring is not meant to be seen as the physical phenomena of reflection. Rather, mirroring is something more social, here is [the term referenced by Wikipedia:(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring): 
```
Mirroring, or the chameleon effect, is the behavior in which one person subconsciously imitates the gesture, speech pattern, or attitude of another. Mirroring often occurs in social situations, particularly in the company of close friends or family, often going unnoticed by both parties. The concept often affects other individuals' notions about the individual that is exhibiting mirroring behaviors, which can lead to the individual building rapport with others.

Mirroring is distinct from conscious imitation under the premise that while the latter is a conscious, typically overt effort to copy another person, mirroring is unconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed.
```

When you use the diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout, there is a key you can press and hold for a short time (it is currently the backtick key: ` ) and the keyboard layout will switch from its primary layout which is diamond\ to its secondary layout which I've set the default to be QWERTY.

### "What? I can change layouts on my Japanese keyboard!"

A mirroring keyboard layout is distinct from a multi-language keyboard layout. I haven't changed languages on the mirroring keyboard layout, only the the way that the keys have been arranged.

Here's an example so you can understand this distinction, let's pretend your girlfriend invites you over to her house to fix an issue on her computer. Unfortunately, you forgot your keyboard with built-in QMK firmware which holds your keyboard layout that you use which isn't QWERTY. You can't just go and tell your girlfriend, "Oh, I need to install my favorite keyboard layout on your computer before I go and fix the issue" no, what you would have to do is solve the issue while using her keyboard in QWERTY assuming she doesn't use any different keyboard layouts.

### "What"?

What makes my mirroring keyboard layout distinct from other keyboard layouts is that it was made for you to be proficient in two keyboard layouts, a primary layout and a secondary layout. The fact is that QWERTY as a keyboard layout has existed since 1874 (according to Wikipedia) and since it is the ubiquitous keyboard layout despite its flaws, almost every software program was designed around the use of a QWERTY keyboard such as VIM.

On the diamond\ layout, it is not VIM friendly, the HJKL navigations are spread far apart, that's one of the reasons why I created the option to toggle quickly to a secondary keyboard layout so that once you exited to NORMAL MODE in VIM, you could switch to the secondary layout and then use the navigation keys as they were placed on a QWERTY layout.

### "But I could switch layouts quickly using the Windows Key + Spacebar key."

VIM doesn't let you use a mouse and its original creation was from a time where the GUI didn't exist. That's one of the reasons I used a button to switch layers without relying on the keys you mentioned which are OS specific and are tied to a GUI.

### "So your keyboard layout isn't a replacement for QWERTY?"

No, my mirroring keyboard layout is an alternative, not a replacement. Instead of trying to replace the ubiquitous QWERTY layout, it is much easier to improve your muscle memory and have two keyboard layouts where their use arises depending on your needs.

### "Oh, now I remember. You explained the backslash before, why is it called diamond\?"

There wasn't an upper row set of keys that rolled off the tongue like with qwerty so I called it diamond\ because that clockwise set of keys in qwerty: YHBG which then become \j/; in diamond\ are shaped like a diamond on a row-staggered keyboard which is of course the kind of keyboard this keyboard layout was designed for. As I mentioned before, they are the most important keys on the keyboard because of having to design the layout around the flaws of a row-staggered keyboard.

## "Can I try your mirroring keyboard layout?"

It is currently set up as a kdb file to use with the program called [Kanata (link: https://github.com/jtroo/kanata)](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) (which is like QMK if you could use QMK on any keyboard). Please use the version in the proof of concept folder but read the bugs in the kanata.kbd file. A reminder that my diamond\ repo on this current page is currently MIT licensed (see the MIT license on this repo for details if you don't know what it does, go to the LICENSE.md file and please read it) so you are free to edit the kdb file on your computer for your personal use and preferences such as having Dvorak for your secondary layout instead of QWERTY for example.

## diamond\ Split Spacebar version and diamond\ Ergonomic version

I have added these versions into their own folders in this repository to describe how they work and any analytical data they provide and what keyboards they require.
