# diamond\ ergonomic version

This is an ergonomic version of the diamond\ mirroring keyboard layout to be used with ergonomic keyboards.

Here is a screenshot of the layout by using the analytical data from the webpage [created by cyanophage on github.](https://cyanophage.github.io/)

Note that you cannot remap keys on the above image, only swap them around. So the keys to pay attention to start from the column containing the 'P', 'H', 'K' keys and going all the way to the right end. The only key to pay attention to on the fourth row (bottom) is the 'E' key as that key is pressed with your left thumb.

My choice with the design of the ergonomic version of diamond\ was to make minimal changes only to the left side of the keyboard. Hence the 'E' key was moved to the left thumb key and the 'O' key moved down to the home row. Where the 'O' key used to be was now replaced with the '.' key and then the '-' key was moved to where the '.' button used to be.

In total there was one key added to the left side: '-' to lower row left ring finger.
Three keys that were moved around: 'E' to left thumb key, '.' to upper row left middle finger and then the 'O' key to to home row left middle finger.

The reason for the minimal design change for the diamond\ ergonomic version is that even though I could move a vowel to the left thumb key, the left side of the keyboard was still delicate that moving another consonant to the left side with break the chacteristics of the keyboard layout that I prefer. Hence that is why the extra key added to the left side of the keyboard was a symbol key: '-'

Since HD Promethium was an ergonomic keyboard layout I mentioned in the backstory of my readme in the repository, here are two screenshots to show a comparison between HD Promethium, diamond\ and diamond\ ergonomic version:
